/**
 * Submits every public URL to IndexNow (Bing, Seznam, Naver, Yandex…).
 * Run manually after a production deploy: npm run indexnow
 *
 * Nothing about the site is restated here. The host comes from lib/site.ts and
 * the URL list from the sitemap the live site is actually serving, so this
 * script cannot drift from either: a page added to app/sitemap.ts is submitted
 * on the next run with no edit here. The previous version carried a hand-kept
 * slug list and a bare host string, and the host silently fell back to the
 * redirecting apex during a domain migration.
 *
 * Reading the deployed sitemap rather than a local build is deliberate. It
 * means the URLs pinged are the ones a crawler will really find, and it makes
 * the script independent of whether anyone remembered to build first.
 *
 * The key file must be served at /<key>.txt : it lives in public/.
